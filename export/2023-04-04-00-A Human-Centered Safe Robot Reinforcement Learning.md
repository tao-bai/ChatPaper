6. Summary:

- (1): The background of this article is that the deployment of reinforcement learning algorithms for robotics applications in the real world requires ensuring the safety of the robot and its environment. Safe robot reinforcement learning is a crucial step towards achieving human-robot coexistence.

- (2): Past methods for safe robot reinforcement learning have been limited in their ability to ensure safety for robots in real-world scenarios. The approach presented in this paper is well motivated, as it proposes to leverage interactive behaviors for safe robot reinforcement learning. Interactive behaviors enable bi-directional information transfer between humans and robots and can help address the shortcomings of past methods.

- (3): The research methodology proposed in this paper is a human-centered safe robot reinforcement learning framework consisting of three stages: safe exploration, safety value alignment, and safe collaboration. Interactive behaviors are leveraged throughout these stages to enable bi-directional communication between humans and robots.

- (4): The methods proposed in this paper are evaluated on various reinforcement learning tasks for robotics applications, and the results show that the framework achieves improved safety and better task performance compared to past methods. The performance supports the goals of the paper, which are to ensure the safety of robots in real-world scenarios and achieve human-robot coexistence.





8. Conclusion:

- (1): The significance of this work lies in proposing a human-centered safe robot reinforcement learning framework with interactive behaviors that leverages bi-directional information transfer between humans and robots to ensure safety and task performance in real-world scenarios. This framework helps address the shortcomings of past methods and advances the goal of achieving human-robot coexistence.

- (2): Innovation point: The proposed framework leverages interactive behaviors to enable bi-directional communication between humans and robots and addresses the limitations of past safe robot reinforcement learning methods. Performance: The results show that the framework achieves improved safety and better task performance compared to past methods. Workload: The framework involves significant workload in terms of designing and implementing interactive behaviors, but the benefits of improved safety and task performance are worth the effort.
